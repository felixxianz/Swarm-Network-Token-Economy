# Executive Summary: 


#### Just like how flowers are magnetic to bees when they bloom.
#### An economy will only take off when there is infrastructure in place.  

The Swarm Network Token economy is designed as “based on contribution” which provides incentives for the bee node operators to build a stable communication and storage system for the Swarm Network. 

There are a few elements in the “BOC” token economy. 
A reward pool (PL)is introduced which is mapped to the “ bonding curve vending machine” 
The bee node shares a portion of the reward pool based on its contribution.
There are three dimensions to evaluate each node’s contribution:
Basic Node contribution is determined by Storage and Communication (SC) capacity and SC effective online Time (T)
The amount of Bzz token bonded with the node will generate Bond Coefficient (BC) to encourage operators stake bee token and support better price for Bzz.   
Stable factor (SF) is a grading system based on stable online time
There will be X portion of Reward Pool PL
For a bee node to get reward is based on how much contribution it has provided:
